  <!--Description-->
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Glazed meatloaf is a comforting and flavorful dish that combines juicy, seasoned ground meat with a deliciously sweet and tangy glaze.
  The meatloaf is typically made with a blend of ground beef, breadcrumbs, eggs, and spices, shaped into a loaf and baked to perfection.
  What makes this dish stand out is its rich glaze—a mouthwatering combination of ketchup, brown sugar, and vinegar—that caramelizes beautifully as it bakes, adding a perfect balance of sweetness and acidity.
  </p>
  <p>This hearty dish is a favorite for family dinners, offering a tender, moist texture with a slightly crisp exterior.
  Served alongside mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, or a fresh salad, glazed meatloaf is a comforting meal that never goes out of style.
  Plus, leftovers make for delicious sandwiches the next day!</p>
