 <h2>Description</h2>
 <p>Italian Ricotta Cookie Bars bring all the classic flavors of traditional ricotta cookies into an easy-to-make, shareable treat.
 These soft and tender bars have a delightful cake-like texture, thanks to the addition of rich ricotta cheese, which keeps them moist and fluffy.
 Infused with hints of vanilla and citrus, they offer a delicate sweetness that pairs perfectly with their signature smooth glaze.</p>
 <p>Unlike individual cookies that require rolling and shaping, these bars are baked in a single pan and then sliced, making them a convenient and time-saving alternative.
 The final touch is a simple yet luscious glaze, often topped with festive sprinkles, giving them a bakery-style finish.
 Perfect for holiday gatherings, tea time, or as an everyday treat, Italian Ricotta Cookie Bars are a delightful twist on a beloved classic!</p>

 <!-- Directions to making the dish-->
 <h2>Steps</h2>
 <ol>
   <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a 9x9-inch square pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides, and lightly grease the parchment.</li>
   <li>For cookie bars, beat butter, white sugar, brown sugar, salt, and nutmeg together in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes.
   Add in eggs and beat for 1 more minute.
   Add in ricotta, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla and mix until thoroughly incorporated. Add in flour and baking soda and mix until just combined.
   Transfer batter into the prepared pan and spread into an even layer. </li>
   <li>Bake until golden and the center of the bars feel just set when lightly touched, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool completely.</li>
   <li>For icing, mix together powdered sugar, melted butter, lemon juice, vanilla, pinch of salt and 3 teaspoons of milk until smooth.
   If glaze is too thick, add another teaspoon of milk until it is a pourable consistency.
   Pour glaze over bars and spread into an even layer. Sprinkle nonpareils over icing before it sets.
   Allow glaze to set before cutting into 16 bars.
   Bars can be placed in the refrigerator to speed up setting.
   Keep bars stored in the refrigerator, but bring to room temperature to serve.</li>
